# üß™ Unit Testing Frameworks

> What are unit test frameworks and how are they used? Simply stated, they are software tools to support writing and running unit tests, including a foundation on which to build tests and the functionality to execute the tests and report their results. They are not solely tools for testing; they can also be used as development tools on a par with preprocessors and debuggers. Unit test frameworks can contribute to almost every stage of software development, including software architecture and design, code implementation and debugging, performance optimization, and quality assurance. [Paul Hamill, Unit Test Frameworks](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/unit-test-frameworks/0596006896/ch01.html)

| [Harmony 2.0](https://harmony.pardeike.net/) | Runtime alter functionality by monkey patching methods
| [Pose](https://github.com/tonerdo/pose) | Pose allows you to replace any .NET method (including static and non-virtual) with a delegate. It is similar to Microsoft Fakes but unlike it Pose is implemented entirely in managed code (Reflection Emit API). Everything occurs at runtime and in-memory, no unmanaged Profiling APIs and no file system pollution with re-written assemblies.
| [Smocks](https://github.com/vanderkleij/Smocks) | Smocks uses some magic under the hood to mock the normally unmockable.

# üßü Mutation Testing

> Mutation testing (or mutation analysis or program mutation) is used to design new software tests and evaluate the quality of existing software tests. Mutation testing involves modifying a program in small ways. Each mutated version is called a mutant and tests detect and reject mutants by causing the behavior of the original version to differ from the mutant. This is called killing the mutant. Test suites are measured by the percentage of mutants that they kill. New tests can be designed to kill additional mutants. Mutants are based on well-defined mutation operators that either mimic typical programming errors (such as using the wrong operator or variable name) or force the creation of valuable tests (such as dividing each expression by zero). The purpose is to help the tester develop effective tests or locate weaknesses in the test data used for the program or in sections of the code that are seldom or never accessed during execution. Mutation testing is a form of white-box testing. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mutation_testing)

# üó∫Ô∏è Automated Exploratory Testing
